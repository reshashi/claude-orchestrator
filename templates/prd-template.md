# PRD: [Project Name]

> Generated by Planner on [DATE]
> Project ID: [project-id]

## 1. Executive Summary

[One paragraph describing what we're building and why. Include the business value and user benefit.]

## 2. Goals & Success Criteria

These criteria will be verified after implementation. Each must be measurable and testable.

- [ ] **Criterion 1**: [Specific, measurable outcome]
- [ ] **Criterion 2**: [Specific, measurable outcome]
- [ ] **Criterion 3**: [Specific, measurable outcome]

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Files to Create

| File Path | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `path/to/new/file.ts` | [What this file does] |
| `path/to/another.tsx` | [What this file does] |

### 3.2 Files to Modify

| File Path | Changes |
|-----------|---------|
| `path/to/existing.ts` | [What changes and why] |

### 3.3 Dependencies

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `package-name` | `^1.0.0` | [Why needed] |

*Or "No new dependencies required."*

## 4. Worker Task Breakdown

### Worker 1: [short-name]

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Task** | [Specific description of what this worker implements] |
| **Owns** | `path/to/files/*`, `another/file.ts` |
| **Off-limits** | `shared/components/*`, `lib/*` |
| **Depends on** | `none` or `[other-worker-name]` |
| **Estimated scope** | `small` / `medium` / `large` |

### Worker 2: [short-name]

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Task** | [Specific description] |
| **Owns** | [Files this worker can modify] |
| **Off-limits** | [Files this worker must NOT touch] |
| **Depends on** | [Dependencies or "none"] |
| **Estimated scope** | [Size estimate] |

*Repeat for each worker (aim for 2-5 workers)*

## 5. Verification Plan

### 5.1 Automated Checks

- [ ] `npm run test` passes
- [ ] `npm run build` passes
- [ ] `npm run type-check` passes
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes

### 5.2 Manual Verification

- [ ] **Test 1**: [Step-by-step manual test]
- [ ] **Test 2**: [Another manual test]
- [ ] **Test 3**: [Additional verification]

## 6. Spawn Commands

Ready-to-execute commands for each worker:

```bash
/spawn [worker-1-name] "[task description]. Owns: [files]. Off-limits: [files]"
/spawn [worker-2-name] "[task description]. Owns: [files]. Off-limits: [files]"
```

## Notes

- **Iteration limit**: Maximum 3 feedback iterations before human escalation
- **File ownership**: Each file has exactly ONE owner to prevent merge conflicts
- **Quality gates**: Each worker PR will go through QA Guardian review
