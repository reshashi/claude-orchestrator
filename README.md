[![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/reshashi/claude-orchestrator?label=latest)](https://github.com/reshashi/claude-orchestrator/releases/latest)

Based on [Boris Cherny's patterns](https://x.com/bcherny) (creator of Claude Code).

> **📦 Latest: [v2.2](https://github.com/reshashi/claude-orchestrator/releases/tag/v2.2)** — Focus-stealing fix, work in other apps while orchestrator runs!

## What is this?

Claude Code Orchestrator enables **parallel AI development** by:

- **Taking conceptual project descriptions** and turning them into executed code
- **Generating comprehensive PRDs** with worker task breakdowns
- **Spawning multiple Claude sessions** as independent workers
- **Isolating each worker in git worktrees** (no merge conflicts)
- **Automating the full pipeline** (PRD → spawn → monitor → review → merge → deliver)
- **Built-in quality agents** (QA Guardian, DevOps Engineer, Code Simplifier)

## NEW in v2.2: Work While Orchestrator Runs

**The orchestrator no longer steals window focus!** You can now work in other applications (browser, editor, Slack) while parallel workers run in the background.

### What was fixed:
- ❌ **Before**: Every 5 seconds, iTerm would steal focus and interrupt your work
- ✅ **After**: Orchestrator sends commands silently without activating iTerm window

### How it works:
The fix replaces AppleScript's `activate` + `System Events keystroke` approach with iTerm's native `write text` command, which sends input directly to sessions without requiring window focus.

```applescript
# Before (v2.1 and earlier) - STEALS FOCUS
tell application "iTerm"
    activate  # <-- This brings iTerm to front, interrupting you
    ...
end tell

# After (v2.2) - SILENT BACKGROUND OPERATION
tell application "iTerm"
    -- No activate command
    tell current window
        tell tab N
            tell current session
                write text "..."  # Works without focus!
            end tell
        end tell
    end tell
end tell
```

│     - npm run type-check                                    │
│     - npm run lint                                          │
│     - npm run test                                          │
│     Workers must pass these BEFORE creating a PR            │
└─────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────┘
                          ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

## Usage Patterns

### Autonomous Project (NEW in v2.0)

Let Claude handle everything from concept to completion:

```bash
# Single command to execute a full project
/project "Implement a rate limiter middleware that:
- Limits to 100 requests per minute per IP
- Returns 429 Too Many Requests when exceeded
- Stores counts in Redis"

# Claude will autonomously:
# 1. Generate PRD with success criteria
# 2. Create worker tasks (e.g., middleware, redis-client, tests)
# 3. Spawn workers in parallel
# 4. Monitor and coordinate
# 5. Review against PRD requirements
# 6. Iterate if requirements not met (max 3 times)
# 7. Generate summary and usage guide
# 8. Notify you via macOS notification + terminal bell
```

### Manual Orchestration

You control when workers spawn, what they work on, and when to merge:

```bash
# In Claude (orchestrator session)
/spawn auth-db "Create users table migration"
/spawn auth-api "Implement login/logout API routes"
/spawn auth-ui "Build login form component"

# Monitor workers
/workers list
/workers read 2

# When PRs are ready
/review           # QA Guardian reviews
gh pr merge 1     # Merge when approved
```

### Fully Automated Orchestration

The orchestrator loop handles everything automatically:

```bash
# Start the automation loop (runs in background)
orchestrator-start

# The loop will:
# - Initialize workers when Claude prompts appear
# - Answer MCP/trust prompts automatically
# - Monitor PRs for CI status
# - Run /review when CI passes
# - Run /deploy for infrastructure changes
# - Auto-merge when all checks pass
# - Close tabs when workers complete

# Check status
orchestrator-status

# Stop when done
orchestrator-stop
```

### Worker Role

Each worker automatically:

1. Reads its task from the spawn command
2. Works on an isolated feature branch in its worktree
3. Creates a PR when the task is complete
4. **Does NOT merge** (orchestrator handles merging)

## Project State (v2.0)

When using `/project`, state is tracked in `~/.claude/project-state.json`:

```json
{
  "project_name": "rate-limiter",
  "prd_path": "/path/to/prds/PRD-2026-01-13-rate-limiter.md",
  "status": "workers_active",
  "iteration": 1,
  "max_iterations": 3,
  "workers": [
    {"name": "middleware", "tab": 2, "status": "working"},
    {"name": "redis-client", "tab": 3, "status": "pr_open"},
    {"name": "tests", "tab": 4, "status": "merged"}
  ],
  "started_at": "2026-01-13T10:00:00Z"
}
```

Project states: `conceptualizing` → `spawning_workers` → `workers_active` → `all_merged` → `reviewing` → `complete`

## Project Configuration

Add permissions to your project's `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(~/.claude/scripts/*)",
      "Bash(git worktree:*)",
      "Bash(osascript:*)",
      "Bash(gh pr:*)",
      "Bash(jq:*)",
      "Skill(project)",
      "Skill(review)",
      "Skill(deploy)",
      "Skill(code-simplifier)",
      "SlashCommand(/spawn:*)",
      "SlashCommand(/workers:*)",
      "SlashCommand(/status:*)",
      "SlashCommand(/merge:*)",
      "SlashCommand(/project:*)"
    ]
  }
}
```

```

## How It Works

1. **Planner Layer (v2.0)**: Takes conceptual descriptions, generates PRDs with worker task breakdowns, reviews completed work, and iterates if requirements aren't met.

2. **Worktree Isolation**: Each worker operates in its own git worktree with a dedicated feature branch. This prevents merge conflicts between parallel workers.

3. **iTerm Automation**: Uses AppleScript to open new iTerm tabs, run Claude in each, and communicate between sessions.

4. **State Machine**: The orchestrator loop tracks each worker's state (NEEDS_INIT, WORKING, PR_OPEN, MERGED) and takes appropriate actions.

5. **Review Pipeline**: Before merging, PRs pass through quality gates:
   - CI must pass
   - QA Guardian reviews code quality
   - DevOps Engineer reviews infrastructure changes
   - Code Simplifier cleans up large PRs

6. **Completion Notification**: macOS notification + terminal bell when project completes.

## Troubleshooting

### Workers not starting

1. Ensure iTerm2 is installed at `/Applications/iTerm.app`
2. Grant Terminal/iTerm accessibility permissions in System Preferences
3. Check that the worktree was created: `wt list <repo>`

### Workers stuck waiting for input

This was fixed in v2.0. The orchestrator now properly submits messages with an explicit Return keystroke.

### iTerm stealing focus / interrupting work

**Fixed in v2.2!** The orchestrator no longer steals window focus when sending input to workers. If you're on an older version, update:

```bash
~/.claude-orchestrator/install.sh --update
```

### False error detection interrupting workers

This was fixed in v2.0. The orchestrator now only triggers ERROR state for actual Claude/system errors (API errors, connection failures), not build/test failures that workers handle autonomously.

### AppleScript errors

macOS may require accessibility permissions:
- System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Privacy → Accessibility
- Add iTerm2 and Terminal to the allowed list

### Commands not found

After installation, restart your terminal or run:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
```

### Git worktree conflicts

If a worktree wasn't cleaned up properly:
```bash
git worktree list
git worktree remove <path> --force
```

### jq not found

Install jq for project state management:
```bash
brew install jq
```
